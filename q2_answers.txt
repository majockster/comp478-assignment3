1.
Laplacian of Gaussian: 
- apply Gaussian blur on image
- apply Laplacian on Gaussian

Canny edge detection:
- Noise reduction
- Gradient calculation
- Non-maximum suppression
- Double threshold
- Edge linking

2.
Edge linking consists of transforming low intensity pixels into high intensity pixels 
if there are neighboring high intensity pixels. The first method needs this step as it would be useful 
to reduce noise

3.
Laplacian of Gaussian: kernel size affects performance, used size 7x7 since it makes
the performance faster and has less noise
Canny edge: lower and upper thresholds affect performance, used 100 and 200 since it makes
the performance faster and has less noise

4.
Laplacian of Gaussian shows the edges of the house, but has more noise than the Canny edge output, which
shows the general outline of the house
